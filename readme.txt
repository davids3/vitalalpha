- When your health becomes zero or you fall out of the level, the level resets and you lose a life
- If all 3 lives or lost you are brought back to the main menu
- Attacking uses up Energy Points (EP), and enemies that come in contact with the blade die
- When your energy becomes zero you are no longer able to attack
- Health Points can be slightly regained from Health Packs, and Energy Points from Energy Packs scattered throughout each level
- Also, your health and energy is reset when you die or you commence a new level
- You gain points by picking up packs and killing enemies
